Description of assignment 2: kinematic analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the second homework to help you in  the project development. 

In the previous step you have created a list of engineering specifications with associated target values and performance indices.
Some of those indices can be purely kinematics and others are more pertinent to dynamic domain.

It is time now time to study the kinematics of one or two solutions for the DRS (depending  on what you have decided).
You have to try to evaluate the solution based on the kinematic engineering specifications and performance indices.
In case you have two or more solutions make a comparison based on the perfoamcne index.

What you have to do in this phase
Specifically what you have to do in this phase are the following steps:

-Derive the 2D kinematic model of one of the solutions (or both or more in case of B, see project description).
 At least one of the two approaches (recursive and global approach) must be used. 

-Compute the kinematic analysis of the selected mechanism:  initial position problem,  position analysis and velocity analysis.

-According to Homework 1 compute the purely kinematic engineering specifications and performance indices of your mechanism

  -possible indices can include working space and velocity that can be reached in each point of the working space
  
  -also tracking of a desired trajectory (inverse kinematics) can be a potential performance kinematic index.
  
-(Optional) Here you may also optimise the mechanism from the kinematic point of view ( system dimensional optimisation ) and perform a sensitivity analysis
