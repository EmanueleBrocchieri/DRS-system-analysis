Cartella per la condivisione dei file per il progetto sul DRS, prof. Biral

In this project wqe are compelled to study and optimize a Drag Reduction System (DRS) actuation mechanism.
The members of this team are Emanuele Brocchieri, Luca Beber and Nicola Saccani from University of Trento.

We need to set a Quality Function Deployment (QFD) chart to prepare ourselves for the design of the mechanism.

Then we are asked to model the system and adress the kinematic and dynamic analysis of several concepts (some already provided).

Finally we need to evaluate the performance of each mechanism and select the best one. The chosen one needs to be further optimized and evaluated once again.

  - Evaluate the kinematics and dynamics of the 3 configurations
      - PUSH-UP -> kinematic done
      - ROCKER-POD -> kinematic needs numerical solution !!
      - POD-PULL -> kinematic done
