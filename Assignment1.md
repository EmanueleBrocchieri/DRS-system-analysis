Description of assignment 1: engineering specifications
This is the first homework that guides you through  the project development. The idea of the project  is to study, analyse and possibly optimise a drag reduction system for a racing car. The drag reduction system system can be controller with hydraulic or electrical actuators. The system must comply with F1 regulations and has to be designed in order to use less energy possible, disturb as less as possible the aerodynamics, be safe and reliable and quickly switch between open and closed positions without residual vibrations. .

What you have to do in this phase
 (refer to the corresponding lecture about the design process):

1) derive the list of customer requirements, that is what are the desired functions of the drag reduction system according to your customers. In your case customers are the internal F1 groups that set requirements for aerodynamics and energy budget. Remember that the list has to be short. 
Then rate the customer requirements based on relative importance,

2) analyze solutions of your competitors and understand what are the pros and cons of the actual available systems
 
3 )derive the list of engineering specifications and the matching with the customer requirements. How well each engineering specification responds to the customer requirements

4) define the target values and the maximum/minimum values for each engineering specifications 

5)Understand the "how"  engineering specifications affect each others and define the performance indices that could be optimised.

Some notes about the different steps:

The above list corresponds to the House of Quality (HoQ) approach. You do not need to strictly follow the HoQ methodology but you can take inspiration to carry out each step.

Divide the engineering specifications between kinematic and dynamics in order that you can leverage the methods that we will study for kinematic and dynamics

Remember to keep it simple (limited in number of requirements) but consistent and well developed. 

Remember that you can refine steps 3, 4 and 5 after you have developed analytical/numerical models and you understand more about the system you are studying.

What has to be delivered at the deadline?
You have two options

- a short presentation where you summarise the results for each steps above and the decisions/reasons of your choices

- a short report short presentation where you summarise the results for each steps above and the decisions/reasons of your choices

Please just report what you have done, decisions/reasons of your choices and results obtained and not the theory or what I said/wrote in the lecture.
