Description of assignment 3: dynamic analysis
__________________________________________________________________________
This is the 3rd homework to help you in  the project development.

In the previous step you have created a kinematic models of the robotic leg and performed various kinematic analysis to meet the list of engineering specifications with associated target values and performance indices (those related to kinematics).

It is time now time to study the dynamics of one ore two solutions for DRS (depending  on what you have decided). You have to try to evaluate the solution based on the dynamic engineering specifications and performance indices. In case you have two solutions make a comparison.

What you have to do in this phase,
Specifically what you have to do in this phase are the following steps:

1)Derive the dynamic models of your system based on the kinematic models you have developed in the previous step. 
  You have also to include the dynamic model of the actuators and transmission system.

2) Some analysis to evaluate the system performance  are:
     -Dynamic analysis of the system imposing some predefined inputs (e.g. as derived from inverse kinematics) and/or some tests that you have selected. (direct dynamics)
     -Analyse the effect of main system parameters on dynamic performance (on performance index)
     -In order to derive the actuator force/torque (also the reference for the control system) you can solve the inverse dynamic problem. Use the Principle of Virtual Work in this case.
     -Friction might be a key element in modelling this system. Analyse the effect. 
     
Compare the system dynamic numerical solution with Maple solver and the DAE numerical methods studied in the numerical part of the course (by prof. Bertolazzi).

Optional analysis:
System optimisation. Try to improve the system performance by optimising some parameters of the dynamic model.
Use MapleSim to create more detailed model of your system especially regarding the the hydraulic and/or electrical actuation subsystem..
